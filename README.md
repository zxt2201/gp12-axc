Problem Descriptionâ€¨The aim of this project is to develop a web-based peer assessment system for students to 
assess the group work of other members in a piece of group work.Peer assessment is a way students can mark the
members of their group based on their contribution and work ethic towards the group project. The marks can
then be distributed accordingly. Currently peer assessment is conducted via a paper-based system, the main 
issue being the time it takes to process them all after they are completed. After collecting the sheets, 
currently the module convenor must physically go through each sheet of paper and physically input the results
of the peer assessments into an algorithm. This is likely to take a long time, since each student completes a
peer assessment for each team member, all of which needs to be input. 

Our proposed solution to this problem will be an online website designed to make peer assessments easy, 
fast and informative. It will also provide a visualized interface for the supervisor and module convener 
to manage the students-database and marking results. This system will implement one specific marking algorithm 
and offer the ability to change the mark for later stages. The project will be built on the implementation of
a MySQL database and the PHP website. This system will be accessible with given IDs and passwords, using any 
browser from a remote client.
